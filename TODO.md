# TODO List

## TODO
 - [ ] Implementing file cache
 - [ ] client
 - [ ] communicaton APIs
 - [ ] logging of operation
 - [ ] scripts for testing
 - [ ] scripts for statistical results

## In Progress
 - [ ] Makefile (skeleton of it: done)
 - [ ] Implementing thread pool for workers
 - [ ] re-defining project structure to conform to the gcc not being able to look into subdirectories automatically without needing to make an entire script and feed it each sub-directory one by one

### Interrogative
 - [ ] Should more utilities be split around?
 - [ ] Where should data structures be taken from? Or is a personal re-implementation preferrable?
  
## Done
 - [x] read of config file
