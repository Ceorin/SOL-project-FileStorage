# TODO List

## TODO
 - [ ] Implementing file cache
 - [ ] communicaton APIs
 - [ ] logging of operation
 - [ ] scripts for testing
 - [ ] scripts for statistical results

## In Progress
 - [ ] Client (Mostly to do but part of the skeleton is completed)
 - [ ] Implementing thread pool for workers
 - [ ] Implementing unix AF_SOCKET between Client and Server

### Interrogative
 - [ ] Should more utilities be split around?
 - [ ] Where should data structures be taken from? Or is a personal re-implementation preferrable?

## Done but could revise
 - [x] Makefile (it's a bit raw and the project structure could change again a little)

## Done
 - [x] read of config file
